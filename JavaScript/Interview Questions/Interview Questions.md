# HTML / CSS
**What is a CSS selector**  
Selectors are used to select elements within an HTML document and then apply styling to those elements. There are lots of different CSS selectors. Some of the most popular include: .class (class), #id (id), element/type selector (like *div* or *p*), child combinator (div > p), descendant combinator (div p), and attribute selector (img[src] or input[type="text"]).

**Describe the box model**  
The box model is used by web broswers to position html elements. Evey html element is represented by a rectangular box. This rectangular box is made up of four parts: content edge, padding edge, border edge, and margin edge. The content edge is the inner most box and contains the html element's content. The padding edge clears space around the content edge. The border edge surrounds the padding edge. The margin edge clears an area around the border edge and creates space between html elements.

**What is the position property and what are its values**  
The position property has 5 expected values which are: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky. Static is the default position for HTML elements and positions the element in the normal flow of the document. A relatively positioned element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, then it's position is offset relative to itself based on the properties top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of other elements. An absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any. It's final position is determined by the values top, right, bottom, and left. Fixed elements are removed from the normal document flow and no space is created for the element in the page layout. It's positioned relative to the inital containing block. It's final position is determined by the values top, right, bottom, and left. Sticky elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and containing block. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.  

**What is the display property**  
The diplay property specifies the type of rendering box used for an element. HTML elements have their own default values which can be overridden. For example, div's are blocks and span's are inline. The most popular display property values are: inline, block, inline-block, flex, and none. Inline displays an element inline. Height and width properties have no effect. Block displays an element as a block. It starts on a new line and takes up the whole width. Inline-Block displays an element as inline, but it accepts height and width values. Flex displays an element as a block-level flex container. None completely removes the element from the flow of the document.  

**What is specificity**  
Specificity is how browsers decide which CSS property values are most relevant to an element and will be applied. Specificity can be thought of as a score/rank applied to styling rules. Every selector in CSS holds a particular weight. For example, the element selector is worth 1 point, classes/attribute/pseudo-class selectors are worth 10, the id selector is worth 100, and inline styles are worth 1000. Inherited values and the universal selector (*) are worth 0. When two styles are competing and they have the same score/rank, the later declared style will be applied (last in, first out).

# JavaScript
**Explain JavaScript closures**  
A closure is an inner function (nested function) that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables. A closure has three scope chains: it has access to its own variables, it has access to the outer function's varaibles, and it has access to global variables. Closures take a 'snapshot' of the outer function's variables and remembers their values after the outer function has finished running. In other words, JavaScript keeps the outer function's varaibles alive because the closure references them. The closure retains state and scope.  

Code Example:  

let counter = (function() {  
  let privateCounter = 0;  
  function changeBy(val) {privateCounter += val;}  
  return {  
    increment: function() {changeBy(1)},  
    decrement: function() {changeBy(-1);},  
    value: function() {return privateCounter;}  
  }  
})();  

console.log(counter.value()) //logs 0  
counter.increment();  
counter.increment();  
console.log(counter.value()) //logs 2  
counter.decrement();  
console.log(counter.value()) //logs 1  


**What is a first-class function?**  
Functions in JavaScript are first-class objects, meaning everything you can do with other types you can do with functions. Functions can be assigned to variables, they can be passed as an argument to another function, they can be returned from another function.  

**What are higher order functions**  
Higher order functions are functions which accept a function as an argument and/or return a function as a result.

**What are callback functions?**  
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function. There are both synchronous and asynchronous callbacks.

**What is event bubbling in the DOM?**  
When an event (i.e. click, mouseover, etc.) happens on an HTML element, it will trigger any handlers that element may have, then pass the event to its parent. This event 'bubbles' up the chain of ancestors, triggering their handlers as well. This process is called bubbling, because events 'bubble' up the HTML tree until the event hits the document object and sometimes even the window object. It's important to note that not all events bubble. For example, a focus event does not bubble. The element that triggered the event is called the target element, and is accessible through event.target.  

To stop an event from bubbling you can use event.stopPropogation(). This function will stop the event from moving upwards, but will allow the element triggering this function to run all of it's event handlers. To prevent handlers on the current element from running use event.stopImmediatePropogation(). However, you shouldn't stop bubbling without a good reason!  

Bubbling is one phase within event propagation. The first is the capturing phase, followed by the target phase, followed by the bubbling phase.  

**What is event delegation?**  
Event delegation refers to the process of using event bubbling to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than on the element on which the event originated. It allows us to attach a single event listener for elements that exist now or in the future. A good example of when to use event delegation is when you've got a *ul* element with many *li* elements. If you need to handle the same event on each *li* element you can add it to the *ul*.

**Whatâ€™s the difference between == and === in JavaScript**  
== is loose equality and === is strict equality. Loose equality compares two values, but does not compare their data type, but rather uses type coercion. This means if the number 7 and the string "7" were compared using == then JavaScript would coerce "7" to be a number. As a result 7 == "7" would be true. Strict equality compares both type and value. It does not user coercion. This means 7 === "7" is false since we're comparing a number and a string.  

**What is hoisting**  
Variable and function declarations are put into memory during the compile phase. This allows varabiles and function declarations to be referenced before they are declared in code. Manytimes people describe this action as 'moving declared variables and functions to the top of the scope' (i.e. hoisted), but in reality the code stays in place.  

An advantage of this is you can invoke a function before it is declared. However, this does not work with function expressions. The same is true with varaibles. If a variable is declared with var, it can be referenced before it is declared in the code, however, it will have a value of undefined since initializations are not hoisted.  

It's important to note the variables declared with let and const are not treated the same as those declared with var. From ECMAScript 2015 -  "let will hoist the variable to the top of the block. However, referencing the variable in the block before the variable declaration results in a ReferenceError. The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the declaration is processed."  

**Describe square bracket notation and when you would use it**  
Square bracket notation looks like this myArray[2] and myObject[thing]. When used with arrays, the value inside the square brackets represent an index within the array. It can be used to view values at that index or to assign values. When used with an object, the value within the square brackets represents a varaible which is assigned the key name on an object.

**What is strict mode?**  
Strict mode makes it easier to write better and more secure JavaScript. It changes previously accepted 'bad syntax' into real errors. Some examples inclmude: you cannot create a variable without first declaring it, variables and functions cannot be deleted, and duplicate parameter names will throw an error. Also, it prohibits the use of specific keywords that may be used in the future like 'arguments' or 'eval'.  

Strict mode can be applied to entire scrips or to individual functions. It does not apply to block statements enclosed in curly braces. To apply it to entire scripts place this statement at the top of the script file "use strict";. To apply it to functions put this statement at the top of the function's body "use strict";.

# Computer Science  
**What is Big O notation**  
Big O Notation is a simplified analysis of an algorithm's efficiency. Good Resource: http://bigocheatsheet.com/  

1. Big O measures complexity in terms of input size, n.  
2. Big O is machine independent. It does not account for the machine the code is run on.  
3. Big O examines the basic computer steps of the code.  
4. Big O is used to analyize time and space.  
5. Big O analyzes an algorithm's worst case efficieny.  

General Rules  
1. It ignores constants    5n --> O(n) instead of O(5n)  
2. Certain terms "dominate" others  
   O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n ^ 2) < O(2 ^ n) < O(n!)  
   (Ignore low-order terms when higher terms exist)  

Examples  
  *Constant Time*: Does not depend on input size. O(1)  
  x = 5 + (15 * 20);   O(1)  
  y = 15 - 2;          O(1)  
  print x + y;         O(1)  
  
  total time = O(1) + O(1) +  O(1)  
              3 * O(1) = O(1)  (we drop constant, i.e. 3)  

  *Linear Time*: Time to run changes based on input size. O(n)  
  for x in range (o, n): print x;  
  n * O(1) = O(n);  

  *Quadratic Time*: For loop in a for loop. O(n^2)  
  for(...) {  
    for(...)  
      console.log('something')  
  }
